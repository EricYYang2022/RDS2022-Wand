To Do:::
1. Port over functions from the main arduino .ino file to header files to be imported
2. Create new function for motor callibration to be called, here we can comment out stuff we dont want to callibrate
3. Create a final python file for configuration and callibration
4. Have everything called internally within the whiteboard demo, s.t. we can just call whiteboard()
