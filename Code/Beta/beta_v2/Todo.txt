To Do:::
1. Have everything called internally within the whiteboard / inertial demo, s.t. we can just call whiteboard()
2. Create a final python file for configuration and callibration
3. Create new function for motor callibration to be called, here we can comment out stuff we dont want to callibrate
4. Figure out time of loop and quantify spring constant
