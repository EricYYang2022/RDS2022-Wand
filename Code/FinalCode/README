This is the final arduino files used to conduct the whiteboard demo, and the whiteboard demo with VR integration. 
Prior to running these files, two libraries must be uploaded to your Arduino IDE. These files are stored beneath the "Libraries" folder in this directory. 



The include Arduino files are:

1) Whiteboard Demo - This runs the whiteboard demo with a hard-coded wall.
2) whiteboard_VR_integration - This file will run the whiteboard demo using the virtual wall from unity. (Note this must be run alongside "readFromUnity")
3) readFromUnity - This file send the VR data from Unity to the robot's arduino. (Note this code is run on the secondary arduino that is wired to the robot's arduino).

NOTE: This code runs using both the ODrive Arduino Library and the Eigen Library, so ensure those are installed before use as explained above.
